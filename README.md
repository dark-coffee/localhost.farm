# Security, the localhost way. |

Welcome to localhost.farm.

Security through obscurity; it's not the greatest thing, but sometimes it helps.


Before I get started, I would like to take this opportunity to say that this is a surefire way to break *everything*. Just because I do something, doesn't mean that you should too. 

Got it? 
Good.

Why localhost?
